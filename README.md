# Predicting Taxi Gratuities in New York City
This page is under construction.

**Overview**

This project aimed to develop predictive models for determining whether a New York City yellow taxi passenger would be a high tipper. Using 2017 taxi trip data, this project constructed multiple linear regression and random forest models. The random forest model demonstrated strong performance, accurately predicting high tippers 86% of the time and correctly identifying high tippers among predicted positives 72% of the time. The analysis revealed that trip duration, distance, and cost were the primary factors influencing tip generosity.
